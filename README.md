# `auth-js` - An isomorphic JavaScript client library for the Supabase Auth API, [Wechat Miniprogram](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/dev/framework/) compatible

Forked from supabase/auth-js, the origional documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/supabase/auth-js).

## Usage

As it serves only as a submodule and workspace dependency in [supabase-wechat/supabase-js], there will be no independent builds out of this repository.

## Major changes

- replace "@supabase/node-fetch" with "@supabase-wechat/node-fetch"
- mute navigator lock
